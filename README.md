BUGS
FIXED
The opening page - Couldn't figure out how to centre on a vertical basis. Help from the tutors at Code institute for reminding me about display:flex and its properties!

THe cards on easymode.html were shifting to the right slightly, realised as I had text-align: center; in the body, this was the issue. Removed and this fixed the issue. 


With the easy mode I started with 20 tiles - Seems a little unfair considering this page will be directed and aimed at Children. 
I brought it down the 16.
